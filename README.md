I chose to prioritize making the functions work described in the task.
For the sake of working fast I have used GO for the backend which I have used a lot with lately.
For the frontend I've used React with JavaScript instead of TypeScript.

1. Run in /backend
```
go run .
```

2. Run in /frontend
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
